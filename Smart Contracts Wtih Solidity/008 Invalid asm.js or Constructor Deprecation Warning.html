<p>In the upcoming lecture, we will be logging the compilation of our script to the terminal. If you are using <strong>solc 0.4.17</strong> as shown in the course, you may get these warnings:</p><p><em>Invalid asm.js: Invalid member of stdlib</em></p><p>or</p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; ':6:5: Warning: Defining constructors as functions with the same name as the contract is deprecated. Use "constructor(...) { ... }" instead.\n' +</em></p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; '&nbsp; &nbsp; function Inbox(string initialMessage) public {\n' +</em></p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; '&nbsp; &nbsp; ^ (Relevant source part starts here and spans across multiple lines).\n'</em></p><p><strong>These specific warnings can be ignored as they will not cause any issues with the compilation or deployment of the contract we are building.</strong></p>
